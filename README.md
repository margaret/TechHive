# TechHive

Overview of TechHive.

See the repository's [wiki](https://github.com/LHSTechHive/TechHive/wiki) (also accessible via a tab at the top of the page).

## Contents

The wiki is not under version control. These are files we want to keep under version control.

### examples

Put code that clearly demonstrates concepts or actions here. E.g. something like a demo to make a "DotStar LED cycle through rainbow colors" could go here.

### one_offs

Put miscellaneous scripts that aren't really important enough to have their own repo but should still be in GitHub here.

### proposals

Put documents here (plaintext or markdown) with ideas that you would like a formal pull request style review on.

### templates

`README_TEMPLATE.md` A template for `README.md` files in new repositories. If you name this file as `README.md` in the top level of your new project's file hierarchy, it will automatically be rendered as the landing page for the repo.

`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` A template for pull requests in a repository. If you add this file to a repository with the filename `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, when someone opens a PR, the description box will be prepopulated with this.
