# TechHive

Overview of TechHive.

See the repository's [wiki](https://github.com/LHSTechHive/TechHive/wiki) (also accessible via a tab at the top of the page).

## Contents

The wiki is not under version control. These are files we want to keep under version control.

`/templates/README_TEMPLATE.md` A template for `README.md` files in new repositories. If you name this file as `README.md` in the top level of your new project's file hierarchy, it will automatically be rendered as the landing page for the repo.

`/templates/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` A template for pull requests in a repository. If you add this to a repository with the same name, when someone opens a PR, the description box will be prepopulated with this.
