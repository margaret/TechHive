# Project Name

High-level description of the repo. What does this do? E.g. “This is the code for the PIdestal component of the [TechHive ARduino Box](linktoproject). It uses an Arduino Uno connected to blah, blah, and blah to rotate the camera mount (pedestal) clockwise or counterclockwise if the red or blue buttons are pressed, respectively. It should not rotate more than 360 degrees in either direction.”

If a repository is deprecated, note that here. There is also an archive feature on GitHub now which you could also apply if a repo is dead.

### Related repositories

E.g. if this is the repo for the PIdestal, probably want to link to the PIcam code. If there is a higher level organizing document, link to that here (or if it’s an internal doc, at least mention its existence and who to contact for access to it).

## Schematics

If applicable. If you upload a photo, take the time to label it (just something quick with microsoft paint or OSX preview is fine). Label parts and circle details that might not be obvious.

## Branches

If applicable. Is there more than one version of this that is being worked on? Write a quick description of each of the branches here. The master branch, unless otherwise stated, should always work if you follow the setup steps.

## Dependencies

What do you need to get this code to do what the description says?

### Hardware

List each part including version number.

### Software

List each software dependency including version number. Include preferred IDEs, link to related third-party libraries, other TechHive code.

## Setup

How do you set up the stuff from the above section? E.g. how do you install the software, does the software run on your local machine (your personal computer) or the microprocessor? How do you connect the hardware? How do you build the code? How do you load it into the hardware? It’s also fine to link to other documentation here instead of retyping everything, e.g. link to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno if you expect people to use the IDE for the development process.

## Tests / Usage

How do you know that the setup worked (e.g. should there be certain LEDs on? Should there be certain output printed through the serial port?)? Are there tests that should pass? If you press a certain button should something happen?

## Contact

Who is the main person/people who maintains this repo? What is the best way to contact them (email them? Create a GitHub issue?)
